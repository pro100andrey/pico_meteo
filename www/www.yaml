# This file is the build-time configuration of static resources and
# custom response handlers to be used in the application.
#
# See: https://gitlab.com/slimhazard/picow_http/-/wikis/Build-time-configuration
#
# The syntax is YAML; see the cheat sheet at https://yaml.org/refcard.html

# This file is named in the picow_http_gen_handlers() directive in
# CMakeLists.txt
# See: https://gitlab.com/slimhazard/picow_http/-/wikis/picow_http_gen_handlers
#
# The top-level item is an array (or YAML "series"), so each element
# is preceded by "-". Each element must be "static" or "custom".

- server:
    # A "static" element names a file in the www/ directory to be embedded
    # in the application, and configures its properties. The "file" field
    # is required. A number of other fields may be set (see the Wiki link
    # above for details), but here we just use the defaults.

    # The defaults for index.html are:
    # - Its contents are returned for the URL path "/index.html".
    #   - Also for the paths "/" and "/index.htm".
    # - The Content-Type header is set to "text/html" (due to the .html
    #   extension).
    # - The Cache-Control header is set to "public, max-age=604800"
    #   (cacheable for one week).
    # - The file contents are minified (due to the inferred type text/html).
    # - After minification, the file is compressed with gzip (also due to
    #   text/html).
    #
    # The result after minification and compression is embedded in flash.
    # The response body is only sent with gzip compression, which is
    # accepted by all of the common browsers.
    #
    # The ETag response header is formed from a hash of the file before
    # any minification and/or compression (true of all static resources).
    - static:
        file: index.html

    # Defaults for img/favicon.png are:
    # - URL path "/img/favicon.png"
    # - Content-Type "image/png", inferred from the .png extension.
    # - Cache-Control "public, max-age=604800" (cacheable for one week).
    # - Contents are neither minified nor compressed (due to "image/png").
    - static:
        file: img/favicon.png

    # Defaults for styles.css are:
    # - URL path "/styles.css"
    # - Content-Type "text/css", inferred from the .css extension.
    # - Cache-Control "public, max-age=604800" (cacheable for one week).
    # - Contents are minified and gzip compressed (due to the type "text/css").
    - static:
        file: style.css

    # Defaults for main.js are:
    # - URL path "/main.js"
    # - Content-Type "text/javascript", inferred from the .js extension.
    # - Cache-Control "public, max-age=604800" (cacheable for one week).
    # - Contents are minified and gzip compressed (due to "text/javascript").
    - static:
        file: main.js

    # Handler for GET/HEAD /sensor
    # Return the most recent temperature sensor reading.
    - custom:
        path: /sensor
        methods:
          - GET
          - HEAD

    # Handler for GET/HEAD /rssi
    # Return the most recent reading of the rssi (signal strength) of the
    # access point to which the PicoW is connected.
    - custom:
        path: /rssi
        methods:
          - GET
          - HEAD

    # Handler for GET/HEAD /netinfo
    # Return the hostname, IP address and MAC address of the PicoW; and
    # the SSID (network name) of the access point.
    - custom:
        path: /netinfo
